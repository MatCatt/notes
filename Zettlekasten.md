A note-taking process popularized by Niklas Luhmann, an author who published over 70 books.
Zettlekasten works by having an archive of small notes, each of those notes being small and linking onto each other. After a while the notes help establish connections you might not have made yourself.

Inspired [[Evergreen Notes]].
