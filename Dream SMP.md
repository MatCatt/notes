An [[Minecraft]] SMP created by Dream, that originally started out for just him and his friend GeorgeNotFound to play with. When he invited streamer TommyInnit they fought several friendly 'wars'. This domino-effected into making the Dream SMP a roleplay server with 40+ members, and a fanbase of millions, thrusting it into the biggest Minecraft SMP ever.
